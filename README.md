# Student's Learning Platform  backend

# UNISLOVE-Back End

Unislove backend containing All list API's and server hosted in port <3002>

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (atleast-- node: 14.17.0, npm: 16.14.13)
- Typescript 
- Express
- MySQL

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 

### Installing

1. You need to install MySql
   - For Windows
     - Install mySql and set following environment variable C:\Program Files\mysql\10\bin
   - For Ubuntu
     - Installation 
        sudo apt update 
        sudo apt-get install mysql
  
2. create ```.env``` from ```.env-example```. then, update database credentials to make connection successfully. if the `.env` file gets failed to load, it can load the default values from `base.config.ts` which is under `/src/configs/`.

3. install all dependencies need for application to run locally 

   **Pre-Note:** After cloning the codebase, make sure ```DB_MIGRATE_FORCE``` and ```DB_MIGRATE_ALTER``` are seated as ```false``` in prod to prevent the data loses.
  ```DB_MIGRATE_FORCE=true``` can drop existed tables and recreate them. ```DB_MIGRATE_ALTER=true``` can alter existed tables instead of dropping them. it can help to prevent loosing data somewhat. but not relay on this always. 

   - ```git clone https://github.com/Inqui-Lab-Foundation/unisolve-be.git```
   - ```yarn install``` || ```npm install```
   - ```yarn start:dev``` || ```npm start:dev``` This will start the application in development mode
   - ```yarn start:prod``` || ```npm start:prod```  This will start the application and run on port 3002

   - **Pre-Note:**: you must build the project once using ```npm run build``` before executing the below command
   - **Note:** For the first time, if you want to create all tables in the selected database, it is recommended to run ```npm run migrate up``` from route directory.

5. if required, you can change port and others details in `.env` file. if the `.env` file gets failed to load, it can load the default values from `base.config.ts` which is under `/src/configs/`.

## Features

- CRUD operations for student

## Database Migration

#### **Generate Migrations(DEV):**

to create a new empty migation file you can run 
```npm run migrate create -- --name=name_you_want_for_migration_file.ts```

upon calling the above command a new file will be generated at src/migrations/migrations/ folder with name xxxxtimestampxxx.name_you_want_for_migration_file.ts
once you have generated migration file you can call 

#### **UP/DOWN Migrations(other than DEV):**

**Note:**: you must build the project once before executing the below command

```npm run migrate up``` command will execute all pending migrations.

```npm run down -- --name=name_of_migration_file_you_wish_to_revert.ts``` command will revert particular migration mentioned in --name 

## Database rules

- Use underscore_names instead of CamelCase
- Table names should be plural
- Spell out id fields (item_id instead of id)
- Don't use ambiguous column names
- When possible, name foreign key columns the same as the columns they refer to

## Running the tests

```yarn run test``` || ```npm run test```

testing with converge of the files

```yarn run test:coverage``` || ```npm run test:coverage```
